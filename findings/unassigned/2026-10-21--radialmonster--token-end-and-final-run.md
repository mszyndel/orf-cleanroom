# Token parse ends 0-7 bits before the payload end; the final 1-run is leftover bits plus the last token

Partial: payload endpoint and terminal-run composition only; whether the leftover bits are padding or a truncated final token, and the cause of the zero endings, are not established

## Claim

On the 87 distinct CC0 `size_class=variable` files of lead #87, a k=5 parse (q zero bits, stop bit 1, 5-bit suffix; escape at q >= 17 parsed as an ordinary token) that accepts a token only when its whole length fits inside the payload ends 0-7 bits before the payload end. The residual-length histogram is 0: 11, 1: 8, 2: 17, 3: 17, 4: 14, 5: 14, 6: 4, 7: 2.

The lead's final run of 1 bits is fully accounted for by those leftover bits and the last accepted token. Let `L` be the leftover bits, `q` and `s` the last accepted token's q and suffix, and `p` the suffix of the token before it. The trailing run of `p + "0"*q + "1" + s + L` (include `p` only when `q = 0`) equals the measured full-payload trailing run on 87 of 87 files. There is no separate 1-bit end marker to account for.

Consequences for the lead:

- The five zero-ending payloads are exactly the five whose leftover bits end in 0. Their residuals are 1431 `110`, 2152 `0110`, 5286 `100`, 6345 `0110`, 7802 `01110`. The final 0 is therefore outside the last complete token, not a property of the last token's suffix.
- The two ten-bit runs, 3210 and 6343, are 2 leftover 1 bits + six 1 bits from `q = 0, s = 31` + two 1 bits from the preceding suffix (`11011` and `01011`), giving 10. The other run lengths decompose the same way.
- For 76 of the 87 files the terminal run begins in bits outside the last complete token; for 11 the leftover is empty and the run is entirely token bits.

A separate tool issue surfaced. The upstream `tools/orf_tokens.py` `scan()` at commit a3fdd6f accepts a final token whose stop bit is inside the payload but whose 5-bit suffix lies past the payload end; it reads that suffix from zero padding. On six files its `bits consumed` is 1-2 bits larger than the payload: 1079, 2150, 7266, 7796, 7798 and 7801. The bounded parse leaves 6-7 bits on those six and rejects the extra token. The trailing-one counts themselves are unaffected because they count bytes, but `orf_tokens.py --all` reports an end position past the payload and a last token that is not in the file on those six.

Not established: whether the leftover bits are encoder padding or the start of a truncated final token. The leftover length is exactly the payload's byte-alignment remainder (0-7), and 49 of the 76 non-empty residuals are all 1s while 27 are not, so no fixed 0-fill or 1-fill rule fits. The zero endings are explained only as "the leftover ends in 0"; a deeper cause is not shown.

## Original evidence

Lead #87, opened by @radialmonster on 2026-10-19, counts trailing 1 bits in the last byte of the then-available CC0 variable-size files and reports 82 of 87 positive with runs of 1 to 10. The corrected full-cohort counts are verified in `2026-10-21--radialmonster--compressed-tail-full-cohort-reproduction` (PR #134); that finding explicitly leaves the token endpoint, padding and the zero-ending cause untested. The token model and the payload locator are from #11 and `tools/orf_tokens.py` (last changed at a3fdd6f); the cohort is the frozen 87-row file `tools/cohorts/lead87-trailing-ones-v1-full.json`, SHA-256 `13d58cd6149671e53cbd853956ac40f0b4673f00bebe3b79e0d10fd1f2ce49e2`.

## Verification

Self-run by the finder on 2026-10-21 UTC, after the lead and after finding PR #134. All 87 files are the frozen cohort; each local file's SHA-256 was checked against the cohort before measurement, and no unused publicly listed CC0 file exists (the catalogue has 104 CC0 files, all already used or listed). This is a new measurement on the same cohort (bounded token endpoint vs. the earlier last-byte count), not unseen-body validation.

Method, fixed before looking at the results: parse MSB-first; accept a token only if `pos + q + 6 <= payload_bits`; stop at the first token that does not fit; call the remaining 0-7 bits the residual. Decompose the full-payload trailing run as described above. The script is in Reproduce.

Residual length: 0: 11, 1: 8, 2: 17, 3: 17, 4: 14, 5: 14, 6: 4, 7: 2.
Full-payload trailing run: 0: 5, 1: 12, 2: 8, 3: 8, 4: 12, 5: 8, 6: 17, 7: 8, 8: 7, 10: 2. This matches the corrected histogram in #134 exactly.

Key rows (residual bits are the payload bits after the last accepted token; `prev suffix` is the preceding token's suffix):

| raw.pixls.us id | residual | residual bits | q | suffix | prev suffix | run |
| ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: |
| 1431 | 3 | `110` | 4 | `01011` | `10011` | 0 |
| 2152 | 4 | `0110` | 0 | `11100` | `11000` | 0 |
| 5286 | 3 | `100` | 1 | `00100` | `00011` | 0 |
| 6345 | 4 | `0110` | 0 | `00001` | `00000` | 0 |
| 7802 | 5 | `01110` | 0 | `00110` | `00000` | 0 |
| 3210 | 2 | `11` | 0 | `11111` | `11011` | 10 |
| 6343 | 2 | `11` | 0 | `11111` | `01011` | 10 |
| 1079 | 6 | `010011` | 1 | `00011` | `00000` | 2 |
| 2150 | 7 | `0011111` | 0 | `01010` | `10111` | 5 |
| 7266 | 7 | `0001111` | 0 | `00010` | `00010` | 4 |
| 7796 | 6 | `001101` | 0 | `01110` | `10000` | 1 |
| 7798 | 6 | `011011` | 4 | `00110` | `00110` | 2 |
| 7801 | 6 | `001101` | 0 | `00010` | `01001` | 1 |

The six 6-7-bit residuals are the six files on which upstream `scan()` overshoots the payload by 1-2 bits; 1079, 2150, 7266, 7796, 7798 and 7801. The reconstruction check had 0 mismatches on all 87. Every file's payload ends at the end of the file; there are no trailing bytes after the payload to complete a leftover token.

Limits: one token model (k=5, escape skip 0); the residual is not decoded or assigned a meaning; no claim about a wider range of bodies or about a decoder's behavior at the end. The difference between padding and a truncated final token is not resolved.

## Reproduce

Download the CC0 files outside the repository, then run the script from the repository root. The downloader fetches the whole CC0 set; the cohort JSON selects the 87 measured hashes.

# Corrected six-file signed-digit bridge-energy range

Author: @radialmonster

## Claim

The six-file signed_digit pooled bridge-energy range is **0.624050 to 1.091014**, across both lane counts, rounded to six decimals. The earlier finding's Claim incorrectly used 0.618104 as its minimum. That value came from exploratory sample 1995, outside its declared six-file cohort. The original finding's six-file table is correct.

This corrects only that range. None of the original 36 pooled sample/mapping/lane-count ratios is at or below 0.5. The signed_low3 range remains 0.740651 to 1.305211 and the unsigned_suffix comparison range remains 0.921650 to 1.780442. The signed_digit one-lane values on 1993 and 1998 remain 0.624050 and 0.643036, below the permutation mean. The original Partial scope and interpretation limits are unchanged; no historical private growth figure or other reading in #32 is reproduced here.

## Original evidence

The maintainer identified the transcription error on PR #145 in [this correction request](https://github.com/radialmonster/orf-cleanroom/pull/145#issuecomment-6307917831). The public design and bridge-energy machinery are @mtakemoto's work in #64 and the #32 discussion. Credit remains with that work and @radialmonster's original partial finding.

A fresh six-file run on 2026-10-21 UTC used unchanged `tools/value_map_probe.py` at commit `bcbf789d84bf75f2724f27e04ab21e2facf9e40e`.

All files were checked CC0 with `tools/pixls_samples.py check` before measurement and already have manifest rows. No new variant assignment is inferred; the existing manifest rows are unassigned. IDs, public names and hashes are:

Every file returned 262144 tokens. In the ID order above, consumed bits were 1595634, 1725464, 1822446, 1595500, 1744299 and 1790936; parsed escapes / omitted blocks were 1/1, 34/34, 313/261, 2/1, 127/118 and 1156/756. All 36 pooled ratios reproduce the original finding's table to six decimals.

## Verification

A second complete six-file run on 2026-10-21 UTC, after correction lead #160 was published at 04:48:02 UTC, repeated both phases unchanged. All aggregate output bytes matched the pre-lead run (discovery SHA-256 37924630ac0c3fada658884659c5fdb92caba89e96a306e65a6630dad39e9fa0; validation e6d6fcc6535cb821a193caba7a177c560228de6bfd67a5f8e891bfbb47237b73). The 16 synthetic tests passed again, and all six CC0 licences were checked again. The corrected minimum and maximum, every original table cell, omission count and consumed-bit count agreed. This is a correction of the original six-file statistic, so the same six-file cohort is required; adding a file or widening the prefix would change the quantity being corrected. This is self-verification by the same human contributor, not independent human verification.

## Reproduce

Use `tools/value_map_probe.py` and its imported modules at the commit above, after reviewing their complete source. Obtain the six public samples, match the hashes above and licence-check each file. Use the exact frozen discovery and validation commands in the corrected finding's predecessor, with `python -I -B` in place of `python -I`; paths are local placeholders. The phase labels retain the original cohort partitions; they do not designate newly untouched data.

From both JSON outputs, select each `samples[].cells[]` with `mapping == "signed_digit"`, both lane counts, and take the minimum and maximum of `pool.R_pool`, comparing its exact numerator/denominator fractions before rounding. There are 12 such cells; the minimum is sample 1993 lane 1 and the maximum is sample 6343 lane 1. Counting all 36 ratios at or below 1/2 gives zero. The reproducible one-off summary calculation is in the correction lead's Reproduce section. All inputs are public CC0 files; no private measurements support this correction.
